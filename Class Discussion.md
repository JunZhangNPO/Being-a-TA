### Context 

- After the presentation
- During the lecture
- Deepen a topic

### Format: Instructor-Student

- 1-1
- 1-N
- 1-n+n+n (group discussion)

### Guidelines

- **Give students some time to prepare**: Even one minute can make a difference.
- **Walk around during the group discussion**: Check their progress and conditions.

### Feedback Framework

- **70% compliments + 30% suggestions**: Use a "sandwich framework" (compliment, suggestion, compliment).
- **100% compliments for all = no real compliments**: Be mindful that too much praise without suggestions can be ineffective.

### Guide Students to Think

Encourage students to consider:

- What concept or perspective are they using?
- What might be missing from their analysis of the topic?

**Avoid vague feedback like "interesting"**: Be more specific with your comments.

### Common Student Tendencies

- They often focus on cases but **fail to connect them with theoretical concepts**.
- They may express **strong emotions or opinions** toward certain topics.
- Their analysis may not always be **sharp or critical enough**.
