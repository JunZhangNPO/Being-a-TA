One student, called S, does a fantastic job in writing emails when reaching out to me for help.

First, S expresses the questions he has about the assignment.  
Then he mentions what kind of help he needs (explaining concepts, checking his work, etc.).  
Next, he provides his availability.  
He also attaches relevant materials, including assignment requirements and the work he has done.

The email is comprehensive and clear, allowing me to set a specific time slot and send the link without needing to ask for extra information.  
After I respond, he sends the Outlook invitation as a reminder.
