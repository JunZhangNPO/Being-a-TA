# **Know Your Students Before Starting Teaching**

## **Case**

When I explained to a student that we could use a quadratic equation with one variable to find solutions, the student looked confused when I showed how to find the maximum value through this equation.

It hurt me when the student said, "What you said does not make sense to me." The assignment was about policy analysis, and I did not expect that the equation calculation would be a problem. Additionally, when I showed that we get the roots by setting the equation equal to zero, the student did not understand what \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\) represent. After I explained that they are the coefficients of the equation, the student said to me, "I do not think you can help me."

## **Lessons I learned**

This experience was unpleasant. However, it reminded me to get to know the students better, understand their mathematical foundation, and address their questions. There should be no judgments based on any background. To be an effective TA, we need to help students with what they need. We experienced different education systems before college, which makes some assumptions about common knowledge incorrect.

## **Question**

After the TA session, I searched for some websites that explain more details about quadratic equations and sent them to the student. However, I am not sure whether I should remind the student to be more polite and how I can express my concerns.
