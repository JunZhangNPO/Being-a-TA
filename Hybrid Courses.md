I attended ICPSR in the summer of 2024. The program has become hybrid since the pandemic.

During the first week, I took Introduction to Python and Introduction to LaTeX, both instructed by Prof. Omer F. Yalcin. The two courses are hybrid, with around 30 participants in person and 20 participants online. Additionally, the courses are recorded, providing opportunities for other ICPSR members to access them. 

I learned some tips for navigating hybrid courses from Prof. Yalcin.

First, check the equipment every time at the beginning of each course to ensure online participants can hear and see clearly. Additionally, remember to record via Zoom. He also wore a microphone to ensure online participants could hear him clearly. Furthermore, when in-person participants speak, the professor gives the microphone to that participant to amplify the sound.

Second, ask the Teaching Assistant to help check the chatbox and other online updates so the professor can be reminded if there is a question online.

Third, encourage online participants to express their opinions via the "raise hand" emoji and respond to questions via the chatbox or by speaking directly. The professor usually stops sharing the screen to see online participants' opinions when he asks questions. A small poll can make the class more active.

At the course Social Network Analysis, the TA usually writes down what in-person students said and put it into the online Chatbox to make online attendees can better know the offline conversation. 

*Deal with technique issue*
take your laptop to access to the Zoom 
have all email address of students and send slides to them via email or the platform
