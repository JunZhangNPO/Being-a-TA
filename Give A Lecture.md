### The Basic Logic of Giving a Lecture

The structure for presenting a topic should follow this basic logic:
- **What-Why-How**
  - What is the concept?
  - Why is it important?
  - How does it work?

- **Concept-Theory-Method-Examples**
  - **Concept**: Define the key ideas or terms.
  - **Theory**: Explain the theoretical framework or background.
  - **Method**: Describe how it is applied or how to approach the topic.
  - **Examples**: Provide concrete examples to illustrate the points.
  
### Timing and Pacing

- **No more than 45 minutes at a time**: Keep the lecture within this limit to maintain attention and effectiveness.
- **Break it into smaller sections**: Divide the content into several smaller lectures for easier digestion.
- **Spend at least three minutes per slide**: Ensure enough time is given to explain each slide thoroughly.
- **Every sentence and figure matters**: Do not skip any information;
- **Less is More** You can overprepare but do not need to show everything to students. Do not rush.

### Questions 

- **Do not ask many questions at the begining**: Give students some time to warm up.
- **Do not upset when no one answers**: It is usually not you fault. However, your emotion can be delivered to students when you get upset.
- **Use Menti.com**: some technology can help with the Q&A
  
### Feedback

- **Ask for feedback regularly**:
  - From **faculty members** especially who has taught this course 
  - From **students** 
  - From **advisors** 

### Incorporate Activities

- **Add interactive activities** to engage students:
  - **Individual activities**: Encourage personal reflection or problem-solving.
  - **Small group discussions**: Foster peer-to-peer learning and collaboration.
  - **Large group discussions**: Engage the entire class in debate or collective problem-solving.
  - **Collaboration and competition**: Use team-based activities or friendly competition to motivate learning.
  - **Have a back up**: when one activity does not work, you need to have a plan B
 
### Additional Content to Consider

- **Use visual aids**: Incorporate videos, diagrams, and other multimedia to cater to different learning styles.
- **Check understanding regularly**: Ask questions during the lecture to ensure students are following along.
- **Adapt to different learning styles**: Some students may prefer hands-on activities, while others benefit from more detailed explanations.

### After the Class

- **Follow up with students** to gauge their experience:
  - Ask for their feelings and feedback on the content and delivery.
  - Conduct a **small quiz** to reinforce key concepts.
  - Encourage students to **write summary notes**: They can reflect on the pros and cons, and what they learned. Give them sticker 
  - **Review your own performance**: Reflect on what went well and what could be improved for the next lecture.
