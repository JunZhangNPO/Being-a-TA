Technology 

Students might need their laptop or iPad to take notes, search for relevant concepts, and review readings. 
However, it’s easy to get distracted by technology—even I find myself checking emails.

For more discussion-based classes, a no-technology rule can remind students to stay focused on the class. 
This helps them pay more attention to their peers.
