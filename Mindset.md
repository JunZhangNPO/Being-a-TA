Imagine you are the instructor when you are taking a course.

- When a student asks a question, you should also think about how you will respond.
- If there are technical issues, how will you navigate them?
- How will you lead discussions?
- How will you deal with controversial topics?
- What can you learn from this instructor?

Take every course you take as a rehearsal for teaching. Then you will be prepared when you are teaching.
