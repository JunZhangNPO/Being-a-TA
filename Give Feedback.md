The following summarizes some tips for giving feedback to students, which I learned from excellent professors.

First, give feedback in a timely manner. Once, during a seminar, I asked a question to the speaker. 
A professor, whose course I took two years ago, sent me an email afterward saying that my question was excellent. 
Although she wasn't obligated to provide feedback, her timely response really encouraged me to do better.

Second, give feedback in a positive way. The sandwich model (positive-negative-positive) usually works.
Additionally, framing matters. For example, I received feedback that said, "Your work is creative but needs more clarification." 
This sentence sounds more acceptable than, "What you say is ambiguous."

Third, give written feedback. 
One professor I work with as a Teaching Assistant provides oral feedback during class and follows up with written feedback via email after class to help students better understand.
