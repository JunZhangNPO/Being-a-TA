I assume it could be tricky to teach courses online, but Prof. John McPeak’s PAI 897 Fundamental Policy Analysis shows me how to navigate online courses successfully. It is a 2U course for online MPA students.

First, he uploads as much course material as possible. He uploads all slides, related workbooks, and figures online before the beginning of the semester so students can get enough information.

Second, he uses short videos to make knowledge more digestible. He uses many videos, each fewer than 10 minutes, to explain key concepts, such as elasticity. Therefore, when students are unclear about these concepts, they can go directly to these short videos. In contrast, reviewing the entire course recording would be time-consuming and create a high psychological burden. For example, for the session on consumer theory, there are 10 videos explaining topics from the indifference curve to the optimal bundle.

Furthermore, there are small quizzes and comprehension checks to test whether students understand the material well. The professor asks if students have any questions related to these quizzes and checks at the beginning of every class. Instead of a mid-term exam or final exam, these little tests provide instant feedback regarding students’ performance and also remind students to preview and review the material in a timely manner. The professor also provides examples of previous assignment titles to help students understand the requirements.

During the course, the professor checks students’ conditions in real time and provides opportunities for their collaboration. He regularly stops and asks students if they have questions. If students do have questions, they are often prioritized. Facilitating collaboration in online courses is challenging. The professor leaves 10 minutes at the end of every class for small groups to discuss their projects. Additionally, when he gives feedback on projects, he provides it during the class and also sends the notes afterward via email.

Additionally, the digital campus platform Canvas provides multiple versions of Zoom recordings. Specifically, it includes versions showing the instructor, the whole class, or with or without screen sharing. Moreover, it has transcripts, sentence by sentence. Students can download the transcripts of the whole course or turn on the captions.

Online courses are not scary. They can be efficient as long as we use appropriate methods to navigate them.
