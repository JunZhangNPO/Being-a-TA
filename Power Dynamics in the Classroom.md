### Instructor-Students 
Instructors usually hold the authority, and students may not have enough courage to disagree.  
**Set democratic rules**: Encourage students to interject whenever they have questions and feel free to disagree.

### Domestic Students and International Students 
**Description**: International students are often concerned about their language skills, and they may come from cultures where public speaking requires more caution.  
**Solution**: Include international case studies, not just domestic ones. Ask international students to share their experiences.

### Talkative Students and Shy Students 
Attendance is encouraged, but it does not mean that more participation is always better.  
We also need to encourage **quality participation**.  
Different forms of participation: class participation and online discussion. Some students may feel more comfortable discussing online.  
**Set a time limit** for each speaker (e.g., no more than 5 minutes).

### Students Familiar with the Topic and Those Who Are Not 
Pair students with different familiarity levels in the same group.  
Evaluate based on progress, not just their initial knowledge or skill level.

### Students Who Already Know Each Other and New Students 
**Description**: Students who already know each other tend to sit together and chat more during and after class.  
**Solution**: Assign groups randomly for discussion so that students can become familiar with peers who don't sit near them.

## How to Distinguish Power Dynamics?
- Where do people sit?
- Who talks more and who talks less?
- Whose opinions get the most support?
- What's their facial expression?
